## Project Overview

### Background

This is a comprehensive car-sharing/rental application built with Next.js 15, featuring a complete role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) system. The application provides users with a robust platform for browsing, booking, and managing rental cars, while offering administrators powerful tools for user management, system oversight, and access control.

### Core Problems Solved

- **Enterprise-Grade Car Rental Platform**: Comprehensive platform with full authentication, authorization, and management capabilities
- **Advanced Access Control**: Implements both RBAC and ABAC for fine-grained permission management
- **User Authentication System**: Complete authentication flow with NextAuth v5 including login, signup, and session management
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full administrative interface with user management, role assignment, and system oversight
- **Responsive Car Browsing**: Clean, mobile-friendly interface for car discovery and selection
- **Booking Management**: Integrated booking system with comprehensive API endpoints
- **Permission Management**: Granular permission system for resources (users, cars, bookings, admin)

### Target Users

- **End Users**: Individuals looking for short-term car rentals with secure account management
- **Managers**: Fleet managers with role-based access to specific resources and users
- **Administrators**: System administrators with comprehensive access to user and system management
- **Super Administrators**: System-level administrators with full access to all features and configurations

## System Architecture

### Overall Architecture

The application follows a **client-server architecture** using Next.js App Router with server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side interactivity.

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Next.js App Router**: Leverages the new App Router for file-based routing and improved developer experience
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Implements SSR for better SEO and initial page load performance
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular UI components for reusability and maintainability

## Annotation-Based Event Tracking System

The car-sharing application features a comprehensive annotation-based event tracking system that provides declarative, type-safe activity monitoring across the entire application.

### Overview

The annotation system allows developers to add tracking capabilities to methods and API routes using TypeScript decorators and higher-order functions. It automatically captures user activities, system events, and performance metrics without cluttering business logic.

### Key Features

- **Declarative Tracking**: Use simple decorators to add tracking to any method
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type inference
- **Security Awareness**: Built-in PII detection and data sanitization
- **Performance Optimization**: Configurable tracking with minimal overhead
- **Flexible Configuration**: Route-based inclusion/exclusion patterns
- **Integration Ready**: Seamless integration with existing activity tracker

### Core Components

#### Decorators (`/lib/annotations/decorators.ts`)

Provides a comprehensive set of tracking decorators:

```typescript
// Basic tracking
@Track({ action: 'READ', resource: 'car' })
async getCar(id: string) { /* ... */ }

// Authentication tracking
@TrackAuth({ action: 'auth.login' })
async login(credentials: LoginData) { /* ... */ }

// Resource-specific tracking
@TrackResource({ resource: 'booking', action: 'CREATE' })
async createBooking(data: BookingData) { /* ... */ }

// Conditional tracking
@TrackConditional({ 
  condition: (result) => result.success,
  action: 'PAYMENT_SUCCESS' 
})
async processPayment(data: PaymentData) { /* ... */ }
```

#### Available Decorators

- `@Track` - General purpose tracking
- `@TrackAuth` - Authentication and authorization events
- `@TrackResource` - Resource-specific operations
- `@TrackBooking` - Booking-related activities
- `@TrackSecurity` - Security-sensitive operations
- `@TrackAdmin` - Administrative actions
- `@TrackPerformance` - Performance monitoring
- `@TrackError` - Error tracking and logging
- `@TrackConditional` - Conditional tracking based on results
- `@NoTrack` - Explicitly disable tracking
- `@TrackClass` - Class-level tracking configuration

#### API Route Middleware (`/lib/annotations/middleware.ts`)

Provides middleware for automatic API route tracking:

```typescript
// Configure middleware
configureAnnotationMiddleware({
  enabled: true,
  trackAllRoutes: true,
  excludeRoutes: ['/api/health', '/api/metrics'],
  includeRoutes: ['/api/cars/*', '/api/bookings/*'],
  defaultAction: 'API_REQUEST'
});

// Use with API routes
export const POST = withAnnotationTracking(
  async (req: NextRequest) => {
    // Your API logic here
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
  },
  {
    action: 'CREATE_BOOKING',
    resource: 'booking',
    extractResourceId: (req) => req.url.split('/').pop()
  }
);

// Use decorator on route handlers
@TrackApiRoute({ 
  action: 'GET_CARS', 
  resource: 'car',
  tags: ['api', 'cars'] 
})
export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  // API logic
}
```

#### Configuration System

Flexible configuration options:

```typescript
interface AnnotationMiddlewareConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  trackAllRoutes: boolean;
  excludeRoutes: string[];
  includeRoutes: string[];
  defaultAction: string;
  extractUserId?: (req: NextRequest) => string | null;
  extractSessionId?: (req: NextRequest) => string | null;
}
```

### Method Interception Engine (`/lib/annotations/interceptor.ts`)

Automatic method interception with:
- Pre/post execution hooks
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance timing
- Context injection
- Result transformation

### Integration with Activity Tracker

The annotation system seamlessly integrates with the existing activity tracking infrastructure:

```typescript
// Automatic integration
const tracker = getActivityTracker();

// Events are automatically routed to the activity tracker
// with proper context, metadata, and timing information
```

### Security Features

- **PII Detection**: Automatic detection and sanitization of sensitive data
- **Data Filtering**: Configurable field exclusion for security
- **Access Control**: Role-based tracking permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for compliance

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Decorators are loaded only when needed
- **Batch Processing**: Events are batched for efficient processing
- **Caching**: Metadata caching for improved performance
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking event emission

### Usage Examples

#### Service Class Tracking

```typescript
class BookingService {
  @Track({ action: 'READ', resource: 'booking' })
  async getBooking(id: string) {
    return await this.bookingRepository.findById(id);
  }

  @TrackBooking({ action: 'CREATE' })
  async createBooking(data: BookingData) {
    const booking = await this.bookingRepository.create(data);
    return booking;
  }

  @TrackConditional({
    condition: (result) => result.status === 'confirmed',
    action: 'BOOKING_CONFIRMED'
  })
  async confirmBooking(id: string) {
    return await this.bookingRepository.confirm(id);
  }
}
```

#### API Route Tracking

```typescript
// app/api/bookings/route.ts
export const POST = withAnnotationTracking(
  async (req: NextRequest) => {
    const data = await req.json();
    const booking = await bookingService.createBooking(data);
    return NextResponse.json(booking);
  },
  {
    action: 'CREATE_BOOKING',
    resource: 'booking',
    tags: ['api', 'booking', 'create']
  }
);
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Actions**: Choose descriptive action names that clearly indicate the operation
2. **Include Context**: Provide relevant context and metadata for better tracking
3. **Handle Errors**: Use `@TrackError` for error-prone operations
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Use `@TrackPerformance` for critical operations
5. **Security Awareness**: Use `@TrackSecurity` for sensitive operations
6. **Conditional Tracking**: Use `@TrackConditional` for result-dependent tracking

### Testing

The system includes comprehensive testing utilities:

```typescript
// Test the annotation system
import { testAnnotationSystem } from '@/lib/annotations/test-example';

// Run test scenarios
await testAnnotationSystem();
```
