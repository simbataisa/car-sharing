2. Email addresses are validated through user interaction
3. Users can set their own secure passwords
4. The process is asynchronous and doesn't require admin coordination
5. Users have 24 hours to activate their accounts
6. **Admins can resend activation emails for pending users**

- System validates the email format and checks for existing users
- Account is created with PENDING_EMAIL_VERIFICATION status
- User is marked as inactive until email verification

### 2. Email Activation Link Sent

- System generates a secure 64-character activation token
- Activation email with personalized link is sent to the user
- Token expires in 24 hours
- User receives professional branded email with activation instructions

### 3. User Account Activation

- User clicks the activation link in their email
- System validates the token and checks expiration
- User sets their own secure password (minimum 6 characters)
- Account is activated and user can immediately login

## Database Schema Changes

### User Model Enhancements:

- `emailVerified`: Boolean field for verification status
- `emailVerificationStatus`: Enum (VERIFIED, PENDING_EMAIL_VERIFICATION)
- `activationToken`: Unique 64-character token
- `activationTokenExpires`: Token expiration timestamp
- `password`: Now nullable until activation

### Status Values:

- `VERIFIED`: User has completed email verification
- `PENDING_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`: User created but not yet activated

## Testing

To test the email activation workflow:

1. **Access Admin Portal**: Navigate to `/admin/users` (requires admin login)
2. **Click "Add User"**: Opens the simplified user creation modal
3. **Enter User Details**: Fill in email, name, and role
4. **Create User**: Click "Create User & Send Activation"
5. **Check Email**: User receives activation email
6. **Click Activation Link**: User navigates to activation page
7. **Set Password**: User creates their password
8. **Login**: User can immediately access the platform

## OTP Verification for Booking Creation

**Important**: The OTP verification workflow is preserved for the booking creation use case where immediate email verification is needed. This allows admins to create bookings on behalf of users with real-time email verification.

## Configuration

Ensure these environment variables are set:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key for email delivery
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`: From email address for notifications
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Base URL for activation links in emails

## Migration Notes

- **Improved UX**: Simplified admin workflow with better user experience
- **Enhanced Security**: Users control their own password creation
- **Better Scalability**: Asynchronous process doesn't require admin coordination
- **Email Service**: Leverages existing Resend integration
- **Database**: Uses new email verification status fields
